 * This program prints out a standard and military clock side-by-side and prints a menu
 * under those two clocks informing the user what actions they are allowed to take.
 * It does this infinitely until a user manually stops the program by entering "4".

 * Program working on Clion IDE with Mac OS as of July 17, 1900.
