College CS C++ course

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
What did you do particularly well?
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?


* This program asks for user input and displays a chart based off the information given.
It was created to imitate a bank account and show users how their interest rates can change
with the addition or subtraction of monthly deposits or a different starting value.

* I was able to very effectlively complete every task that was asked of me when it came to this
 project with the exception of forgetting to round my numbers to two decimal places. The error
 checking works very well, I use private variables for user input, and the calculation work as 
 expected. 
 
 * I could have put more effort into my header file and my other class that is outside the main.
 As it is right now most of the code is contained in the same class as the main method. I also
 could have added another method that validated the user input instead of copy/pasting the same 
 looping sequence 3 times. 
 
 * The most challenging part of this project for me was the math. My numbers kept coming out wrong 
 it took my hours to finally figure out what the issue was. I used my resources the professor had 
 provided and it solved the issue. If I had read the instructions more carefully from the git-go
 It would have saved me a alot of extra time. 
 
 * Error checking is a good skill to have as well as encapsulating data. 
 
 * I added many comments to this code so it could easily be read and maintained if need be. I don't 
 think anyone would struggle in figuring out what I have written anywhere in my code.
